CAP Theorem:
The logic is intuitive: if two nodes can’t communicate (because the network is parti‐
tioned), then the system as a whole can either stop serving some or all requests at
some or all nodes (thus reducing availability), or it can serve requests as usual, which
results in inconsistent views of the data at each node.

Byzantine fault tolerance

edge cases

secret sprawl - passwords hardcoded in apps, stored in multiple configs all over the infrastructure

noizy neighbour - when tenant utilize all resources in multitenant env
